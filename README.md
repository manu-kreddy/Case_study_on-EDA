📊 EDA Case Study: Insurance Data
Hey there! 👋
This is a simple little project where I explore an insurance dataset using Python. It’s all about understanding what the data looks like — things like who smokes, which regions people come from, and some basic stats. Nothing fancy, just classic EDA.

**🚀 What does this do?**
Loads up an insurance CSV file with pandas.

Checks out the shape of the data (rows & columns), lists the columns, and looks for any missing stuff.

Prints out the first and last few rows to get a feel for it.

Counts how many smokers vs non-smokers there are, and how people are spread across regions.

Shows some basic statistics (like averages, min, max) for both numbers and categories.

It’s basically a first pass to see what we’re working with before building models or charts.

**📝 The data**
This uses a typical insurance dataset. It usually has columns like:

age - how old the insured person is

sex - male or female

bmi - body mass index

children - number of kids covered

smoker - yes or no

region - where they live in the US

charges - the insurance cost charged to them

Make sure your file is called something like insurance.csv (or update the path in the script).

**💻 How to run it**
Super simple:
Make sure you have Python installed, along with pandas and numpy.
pip install pandas numpy
Put your CSV file in the same folder (or adjust the path in the script).

Run it like this:
python edacasestudy1.py
And you’ll see the data summaries right in your terminal.
**Final note**
I hope you find this case study useful.
I’ve done this to improve my pandas, NumPy, and overall EDA skills.
I plan on working on more such case studies in the near future — so stay tuned!
