# üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Case Studies

This repository contains two Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects performed in Python using pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. These case studies demonstrate data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization.

## üìÅ Project Overview

### üöÄ Case Study 1 - Insurance Dataset EDA
- Performs detailed EDA on an insurance dataset.
- Analyzes age, BMI, charges, and region impact.
- Uses plots like histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to uncover insights.
- Checks for outliers and correlations.

### ‚òï Case Study 2 - Commodity Prices Analysis
- Analyzes a commodity prices dataset from 1960-2022.
- Finds max/min prices of Robusta coffee from 1960-1980.
- Compares price trends and volatility of Arabica vs Robusta coffee.
- Plots sugar world prices over time.
- Determines the commodity with the highest average price.
- Creates new columns based on business rules.
